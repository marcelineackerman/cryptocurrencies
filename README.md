# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
An analysis of cryptocurrency data using unsupervised machine learning, utilizing the following tools:

 - `Python 3.7`
 - `Pandas library`
 - `Plotly`
 - `Scikitlearn`
 - `hvplot`
 
 ## Summary
 
 Utilizing machine learning, this project was able to cluster tradable cryptocurrencies into four groups based on the KMeans algorithm, after Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, then plotted those clusters on a 3D scatter plot. Going further, we were able to group cryptocurrencies based on their total supply as well as total coins mined on a 2D scatter plot to see which currencies are mineable.
